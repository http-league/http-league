# HTTP League

## Introduction

HTTP League is designed with aspiring developers in mind. We wanted to create a place where new developers can submit a website of their own, where when posted other authorized users are able to provide feedback on the site that was submitted. If you are not necessarily looking to submit a site yet then we are also providing a section where users are able to browse other predetermined sites for inspiration on their next project.
